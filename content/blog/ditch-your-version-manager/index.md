You probably use a variety of tools to manage your Ruby, Node, Python,
Elixir versions, such as [rvm](http://rvm.io/),
[rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv),
[nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), or [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/).
They all work reasonably well, right?

Well, not quite.

The fundamental issue is that many programs depend on other programs being
present in the same system. For many years, if you wanted to install
[nokogiri](https://nokogiri.org/), a popular XML parser written in Ruby,
you'd have to remember to install `libxml` beforehand. Furthermore, some of
these programs depend on OS-specific configurations, such as libraries
shipped with Mac OS or Linux.

It's not uncommon to check out a project and having to install a plethora
of libraries and tools, and having to hope that the versions that you
installed are compatible with the ones used by the original authors. Then
you'd have to figure out a way to install an older version of a specific
package.

I can hear what you're wondering now: what about
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)? The idea of having a container image
that contains all your dependencies sounds very promising indeed. The issue
with docker images is that all those dependencies are still intertwined,
only the whole dependency tree has become *invisible*: for example, if the
version of Ubuntu you are using has reached its End-Of-Life, you will have
to manually untangle all the dependencies and update everything in one go.
If you're working on a large project with many dependencies, please accept
my condolences.

My ideal dependency manager would allow me to specify **each and every**
dependency that is required to build and work on my projects. It should be
easily reproducible, declarative and easy to upgrade.

Does it sound too good to be true?

## Welcome to the jungle

Let me introduce you to [Nix](https://nixos.org/).

> Nix is a tool that takes a unique approach to package management and system configuration. Learn how to make reproducible, declarative and reliable systems.

Let's try it out.

```bash
$ sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --daemon
```

```bash
$ nix-env --version
nix-env (Nix) 2.3.10
```

Great, what I haven't told you is that Nix is also a pure, lazy, functional
programming language. Exciting!

Before we can start on our first project we will need to install
[direnv](https://direnv.net/), a tool which will let us build
a custom environment in a specific folder. You'll need to:

- `brew install direnv`
- [hook direnv into your shell](https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html)
- restart your shell

Now we're ready to go!

Let's create a new folder:

```bash
$ mkdir nix_hello_world

$ cd nix_hello_world

$ hello
-bash: hello: command not found
```

As you can see, no `hello` command is available yet. We can create a `default.nix` like this one:

```nix
let
  pkgs = import <nixpkgs> { };
in
pkgs.mkShell {
  buildInputs = [ pkgs.hello ];
}
```

And we can tell direnv to load this file and update our environment.

```bash
$ echo "use nix" > .envrc
direnv: error /Users/arkham/Desktop/nix_hello_world/.envrc
is blocked. Run `direnv allow` to approve its content

$ direnv allow
<loads of nix output>

$ hello
Hello, world!
```

ðŸŽ‰

What did we do?

- we imported the whole set of packages provided by Nix and called it `pkgs`
- we used the `mkShell` built-in function to create a new environment where
  we can use Nix programs
- we specify we want the GNU `hello` program

What if we wanted ruby? Couldn't be simpler:

```nix
let
  pkgs = import <nixpkgs> { };
in
pkgs.mkShell {
  buildInputs = [
    pkgs.hello
    pkgs.ruby
  ];
}
```

By saving this file and returning to your shell, Nix will pick up the
change and install the new dependency.

```bash
$ ruby --version
ruby 2.7.4p191 (2021-07-07) [x86_64-darwin17]

$ which ruby
/nix/store/r6siyyqmnidkn2y8y5hl7payykb51kb0-ruby-2.7.4/bin/ruby
```

What's with that super long path? Don't worry, it's just how Nix stores its
data (*waves hands.. iMmUTaBIlitY*).

What if I needed node?

```nix
let
  pkgs = import <nixpkgs> { };
in
pkgs.mkShell {
  buildInputs = [
    pkgs.hello
    pkgs.ruby
    pkgs.nodejs
  ];
}
```

```bash
$ node --version
v14.17.2

$ which node
/nix/store/zj1sqykb3s5a0fakm94qwz7fg6g2zxpm-nodejs-14.17.2/bin/node
```

You can see the pattern here.

But what if I wanted a different version of Ruby or Node? Let's say that our
project depends on Ruby 2.6 and Node 10. We can [go and search](https://search.nixos.org/packages) for those specific versions, then change our `default.nix` accordingly:

```nix
let
  pkgs = import <nixpkgs> { };
in
pkgs.mkShell {
  buildInputs = [
    pkgs.hello
    pkgs.ruby_2_6
    pkgs.nodejs_10
  ];
}
```

```
$ ruby --version
ruby 2.6.8p205 (2021-07-07) [x86_64-darwin17]

$ node --version
v10.24.1
```

ðŸŽ‰

## Some bad news

Unfortunately, if you tried to follow this article step by step, you'll
have noticed that the versions of `ruby` and `node` you installed are
probably slightly different from the ones above.

Wasn't Nix supposed to give us _reproducible_ builds?

Yes, but...

All the software that we installed depends on the specific version of the
nixpkgs channel that we installed on our system.

## niv

In order to pin our configuration to a specific version, we can use
[niv](https://github.com/nmattia/niv).

Let's install it:

```bash
$ nix-env -iA nixpkgs.niv
```

Now we can initialize a niv project:

```bash
$ niv init
Initializing
  Creating nix/sources.nix
  Creating nix/sources.json
  Using known 'nixpkgs' ...
  Adding package nixpkgs
    Writing new sources file
  Done: Adding package nixpkgs
Done: Initializing
```

This command generates a couple files:

```bash
$ tree
.
â””â”€â”€ nix
    â”œâ”€â”€ sources.json
    â””â”€â”€ sources.nix

1 directory, 3 files
```

The `sources.json` contains the fixed version of the nixpkgs repo that
we're going to use. Don't worry about the `sources.nix` file, it's mostly
glue to allow us to load a JSON file in Nix.

For the sake of reproducibility, change your `sources.json` to look like
this:

```json
{
    "nixpkgs": {
        "branch": "release-21.05",
        "description": "Nix Packages collection",
        "homepage": "",
        "owner": "NixOS",
        "repo": "nixpkgs",
        "rev": "5f244caea76105b63d826911b2a1563d33ff1cdc",
        "sha256": "1xlgynfw9svy7nvh9nkxsxdzncv9hg99gbvbwv3gmrhmzc3sar75",
        "type": "tarball",
        "url": "https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/5f244caea76105b63d826911b2a1563d33ff1cdc.tar.gz",
        "url_template": "https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/archive/<rev>.tar.gz"
    }
}
```

Now we can create our top-level Nix configuration:

```nix
let
  sources = import ./nix/sources.nix { };
  pkgs = import sources.nixpkgs { };
in
pkgs.mkShell {
  buildInputs = [
    pkgs.hello
    pkgs.ruby_2_6
    pkgs.nodejs_10
  ];
}
```

You will see now that the versions of ruby has slightly changed:

```bash
$ ruby --version
ruby 2.6.7p197 (2021-04-05) [x86_64-darwin17]
```

But the good news is that configuration will work **forever**. That's
right, the moment you commit this configuration to your project you will
ensure that it will never stop working.

Need to install a new tool? Pop it in the Nix config.
Need to patch a program and make sure every one is using it? Create an
[overlay](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Overlays), pop it in the Nix file and
grab your pop corn.

Nix is a version manager for everything. You will never have to tell
someone: "Oh right, you need to install this version of LLVM to get this
thing to work". They can pull the repo, `direnv allow` and BAM, fully
working project setup.

What are you waiting for?!
