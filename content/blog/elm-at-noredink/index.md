At [NoRedInk](https://www.noredink.com) we have one of the largest Elm apps
in the world. It serves millions of teachers and students every day and our
frontend is exclusively written in Elm. In this post, we will explore the
structure of our application and the patterns that we use to stay sane. One
of the most common questions I get about Elm is:

> "Does it scale? And if so, how"

Well, I hope that this post can become a comprehensive answer to that
question.

## Some stats first

We have a glorious monorepo which contains all the services that power our
infrastructure. Our biggest application (aka the `monolith`) is written in
Rails and has a `ui` folder with all of our Elm frontend code.

```bash
$ find monolith/ui/src -name "*.elm" | xargs cat | wc -l
275082

$ find monolith/ui/tests -name "*.elm" | xargs cat | wc -l
209107
```

As you can see, we write loads of tests. As much as the Elm compiler gives
you that wonderful confidence while refactoring, we still want to make sure that
the code that we push is as correct as it can be.

In ["What to know before debating type
systems"](https://cdsmith.wordpress.com/2011/01/09/an-old-article-i-wrote/),
two different approaches are given to help us writing correct programs:

- **Proof**: establishes lower bounds on correctness
- **Testing**: establishes upper bounds on correctness

> An important point here is that static typing does not preclude proving
> correctness in the traditional way, nor testing the program. It is a
> technique to handle those cases in which testing might be guaranteed to
> succeed so they donâ€™t need testing; and similarly, to provide a basis
> from which the effort of manual proof can be saved for those truly
> challenging areas in which it is necessary.

## Rails conventions

Following the Rails architecture, each REST resource is managed by its
controller. So when a teacher wants to manage their classes:

- they visit the `/teach/classes` URL
- that route is managed by the `Teach::ClassesController` controller
- that controller will fetch stuff from the database, clean it up and load a view

That view looks like this:

```haml
- content_for :title, "Manage Classes | NoRedInk"

- content_for(:javascript) do
  = javascript_include_tag "shake/Page/Teach/Classes/index.js"

= elm_mount(@elm_flags, 'teach-classes-elm')
```

What is that `elm_mount` helper? We define it to be like this:

```ruby
def elm_mount(flags, prefix = 'elm')
  tag.div(id: prefix + '-flags',
          class: "elm-flags",
          data: {flags: flags.to_json}) +
    tag.div(id: prefix + '-host')
end
```

In short, we need some conventions for the names of two nodes:
- the one that contains the flags that we pass from Rails to Elm
- the one that will contain the actual Elm app when it's mounted

The javascript file that we include is the result of the compilation of the
Elm app. We use a build system called [Shake](https://shakebuild.com/) to
generate all our assets. The actual entrypoint looks like this:

```javascript
import { Elm } from "./Main.elm";
import * as NriProgram from "Nri/Program.js";
import setupReadAloud from "ReadAloud/setup.js";

NriProgram.domready(function () {
  const { subscribe, send } = NriProgram.mountPorts(
    Elm.Page.Teach.Classes.Main,
    "ui/src/Page/Teach/Classes/index.js",
    "teach-classes-elm"
  );

  setupReadAloud({ subscribe, send });
});
```

The `NriProgram` that you see here is a small wrapper around common
operations that we need to perform, such as:
- passing an environment object to our Elm apps so that we can have different
  settings in test, development and production
- setting up some basic analytics and reporting
- grabbing the flags and the div where the Elm app will be mounted
- giving us the ability to easily set up ports using `subscribe` and `send`

Another interesting bit is the convention that we use to name our Elm
modules. Since the URL is going to be `/teach/classes`, the associated Elm
module is going to be `Page.Teach.Classes.Main`. Here are some other
examples:

- `Page.Admin.RelevantTerms.Main` corresponds to `/admin/relevant_terms`
- `Page.Learn.ChooseSourceMaterials.Main` corresponds to `/learn/choose_source_materials`
- `Page.Preferences.Main` corresponds to `/preferences`
- `Page.Teacher.Courses.Assignments.Main` corresponds to `/teach/courses/:id/assignments`

In total, we have around 80 Elm apps that serve different Rails
controllers. They consist of a mixture of normal applications and single page
applications. By adapting the Rails motto "convention over configuration"
we're confident we can scale this approach indefinitely. Let's take a deeper look!

## Our Elm apps

At this point, you probably won't be surprised to learn that we use a
custom wrapper as the entrypoint of our Elm programs. Here is how it looks
like:

```elm
main : Nri.Program.Program Model Msg
main =
    Nri.Program.program
        { moduleName = "Page.Interests.Main"
        , flagsDecoder = \_ -> decode
        , perform = perform
        , init = init
        , view = view
        , update = update
        , subscriptions = \_ -> Sub.none
        }
```

Let's compare it to `Browser.element` from `elm/browser`:

```elm
main : Browser.Program flags model msg
main =
    Browser.element
        { init = init
        , view = view
        , update = update
        , subscriptions = \_ -> Sub.none
        }
```

As you can see, the types are slightly different and we include a couple of
different fields in our version.

What are the advantages of using a custom `Nri.Program`?

- **reducing boilerplate**: for example, we can automatically handle decoding failures so that
  we don't have to worry about them in each individual page.
- **handling generic behaviours**: for example, we can automatically detect the user's
  input method to make our product more accessible.

The differences don't stop there. Let's look at the type of the `view` function:

```elm
view : Env -> Model -> Html Msg
```

Here we take an additional `Env` argument. This record contains information
about the current release, the logged in user and the environment where the
code is running. For example, if we detect that we are running in test
mode, there is no need to run fancy UI animations, thus we can disable
them. This in turn makes our tests faster and less flaky.

If you look at the record that we pass to `Nri.Program.program` you will notice
an additional `perform` field. Let's look at the type signature:

```elm
perform : Env -> Effect -> Cmd Msg
```

This is easier to understand if we look at the type signature of `update`:

```elm
update : Env -> Msg -> Model -> ( Model, Effect )
```

The curious change is that a standard update function in Elm returns a
`(Model, Cmd Msg)` tuple, while ours returns `(Model, Effect)`. Why is
that? `Cmd Msg` is an opaque type that is meant to be passed as-is to the
Elm runtime.  But in order to test that the correct side effect has been
emitted we need to be able to inspect it: so we define our own type and we
call it `Effect`.

Then we can use the fantastic `elm-program-test` library (you can find it
[here](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/avh4/elm-program-test/latest))
to test our Elm programs.  In the meanwhile, in our normal application we
can use the `perform` function to convert the `Effect` representation of a
side effect to its `Cmd Msg` counterpart.

Similarly, we have another custom wrapper for single page applications called
`Nri.Spa.Program` which mostly wraps `Browser.application`.

The general lesson here is that just because Elm provides an `update`
function with the shape `msg -> model -> (model, Cmd msg)` your own
version **doesn't need to**. You might need more arguments, or different
types, or even more return values.  As long as you convert the result of
your function to match the API of `Browser.element` you can have any level
of customization.

## How to write Elm files

We don't believe in the mantra:

> Prefer small files

Here is a little snapshot of some large files in our codebase:

```bash
2251 src/Page/Learn/GuidedDrafts/Main.elm
1773 src/Page/Curriculum/BrowseAndAssignLayout.elm
1725 src/Page/Teach/Classes/Page/Classes/Explore.elm
1691 src/Page/Teach/Assignment/Form/GuidedDraft/Customize.elm
1524 src/Page/Teach/Courses/PeerReviews/Progress.elm
1280 src/Page/Admin/Alignments/Main.elm
1188 src/Page/Learn/Home/Main.elm
1184 src/Page/Teach/Assignment/Form/Model.elm
1136 src/Page/Preview/PeerReview/Main.elm
```

As Evan Czaplicki explains in [this
talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch/XpDsk374LDE), larger files in Elm are
not a problem. We tend to delineate the different sections related to
model, update and view with comments. Then we extract functions around
their data structures, rather than their perceived role.

Another point I want to emphasize is that in Elm you don't have to get
everything right from the start. Choose the simplest architecture that
works. If you need to change it later, the compiler will assist you in
every step of the way. Specifically for this sort of mechanical changes,
the chance of introducing bugs is very close to zero. If it compiles, it
works.

## Nesting the Elm Architecture

When we need to combine multiple Elm applications, we nest them under one
another. So for example if we have a modal in a page with its own state and
its own messages, we will do this:

```elm
type alias Model =
    { modal : Modal.Model
    }

type Msg = ModalMsg Modal.Msg

update : Env -> Msg -> Model -> ( Model, Effect )
update env msg model =
    case msg of
        ModalMsg modalMsg ->
            let
                ( newModal, modalEffect ) =
                    Modal.update env modalMsg model.modal
            in
            ( { model | modal = newModal}
            , ModalEffect modalEffect
            )

view : Env -> Model -> Html Msg
view env model =
    div []
        [ Modal.view env model.modal |> Html.map ModalMsg
        , span [] [ text "Hello there" ]
        ]
```

This is how we build big apps in Elm. That's the secret sauce. By applying
this concept repeatedly you can scale your Elm apps as much as you want.
Here is the actual `Msg` type of our `Teach.Classes.Main` module:

```elm
type Msg
    = ChangePage Route
    -- Nested TEA
    | TimedAlerts Alert.Msg
    | ClassesMsg Classes.Msg
    | ModalMsg Modal.Msg
    | EditClassMsg EditClass.Msg
    -- HTTP responses
    | ReceiveClasses
        Class.RedirectToClass
        (WebData
            { activeClasses : List Class.Class
            , archivedClassCount : Int
            }
        )
    | ReceiveArchivedClasses (WebData (List Archived.Class))
    -- DOM focus
    | Focus String
    | Focused (Result Dom.Error ())
    -- User actions
    | OpenModal Modal.Kind String
    | CloseModal
    | SetModalKind Modal.Kind
    | ModalError Http.Error
    | AddStudent Modal.CreateStudentAccountsManuallyModel
    | Archived Int
    | Unarchived Int
    | ToggleTooltip String Bool
```

## When to nest TEA modules

If you looked at the section above and you thought "Welp, that looks like a
lot of work", I hear you. As a matter of fact, we don't need to do the
whole TEA-nesting dance everytime we want to reuse a module. In fact, most of
the UI components that we use don't have their own state, so they don't
need even need their own `update` function. Let's look at how we use a
button:

```elm
import Nri.Ui.Button.V10 as Button

view : Env -> Model -> Html Msg
view env model =
    div []
        [ Button.link "Edit"
            [ Button.css [ Css.marginBottom (Css.px 10) ]
            , Button.onClick EditAssignment
            , Button.icon UiIcon.calendar
            , Button.small
            ]
        ]
```

It seems obvious, but if there is no state, then there is no need to do
extra work. If you are curious on how we structure our UI components, you
can take a gander at [noredink-ui](https://github.com/NoRedInk/noredink-ui) (or
check out the preview [here](https://noredink-ui.netlify.app/)). We're
always including simple examples for each UI component, so that they act as
the best documentation possible
([component](https://noredink-ui.netlify.app/#/doodad/Switch) /
[example](https://github.com/NoRedInk/noredink-ui/blob/master/styleguide-app/Examples/Switch.elm)).

In a way, if you feel that it is too complex to nest TEA applications,
it's because it is. I would recommend reaching for it as a last resort,
like using a big bazooka to plant daffodils in your garden: it works, but
it's a bit heavy handed.

Instead you might find some abstractions which don't require another model
and another set of update messages. You can do lots with a view function
that takes a config record and an extensible record:

```elm
viewSidebar :
    { onClick : msg, onClose : msg }
    -> { a | sidebarItems : List SidebarItem }
    -> Html msg
```

As mentioned above, choose the simplest solution that works. Later you can
refactor and make it feel good. You can watch [this
talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoA4Txr4GUs) by Richard Feldman if you want
to learn more.

A good point to reiterate is that, when writing Elm, you don't have to get
everything right from the start. The compiler gives you an unprecedented
level of confidence when refactoring code. So go out there and make
mistakes, then fix them, then keep going.

## Interacting with JavaScript

We mainly use [ports](https://guide.elm-lang.org/interop/ports.html) to
interact with JavaScript code. We have two simple rules for ports:
- All ports **must** return values as `Json.Value`. If a `Int -> Cmd msg`
  port receives a float instead, it will crash. This is one of the simplest
  ways to introduce runtime errors in your application. By treating all
  values as JSON blobs, we must decode them and deal with the eventual
  decoding failure.
- All port functions **must** be documented in the Elm module. We don't want to
  go hunting in JavaScriptLand how a port is being used. A couple of
  lines explaining what the port triggers can go a long way.

In cases where ports are not enough, we use [custom
elements](https://guide.elm-lang.org/interop/custom_elements.html). You
might want to do this for many reasons, such as reusing [existing React
components](https://github.com/cultureamp/react-elm-components) inside your
Elm application. In our case, we have integrated rich text editing on our
product using a custom element that wraps [quilljs](https://quilljs.com/).
If you're interested in learning more about integrating custom elements in
Elm, I recommend watching [this
talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyFe9Pw6TVE) by Luke Westby.

## Testing

We write tests for our Elm code at four different layers:

- **Unit tests**: these are pure tests around data structures. Create a piece
  of data, run a function on it and assert some results.
- **View tests**: here we construct a model, we pass it to the view
  function and write assertions against the result using `elm-explorations/test`.
- **Integration tests**: here we load up a generated JSON file, pass it to
  a `elm-program-test` Program, interact with the elements in the page,
  and assert side effects.
- **Acceptance tests**: we write these in Capybara as golden-path tests.
    They are extremely useful to test JavaScript interop.

## Tooling

Here's a selection of tools that we use:

- [elm-format](https://github.com/avh4/elm-format), the Holy Grail of code
  formatters. I love repeating "garbage in, code out". In this
  case, it happens to be beautifully formatted, while respecting your preference
  in terms of whitespace, and applying tiny cleanups of your code on the
  fly. What's not to like?
- [elm-css](https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-css), so that our CSS is
  typed. We use it so much that the `view` function in our `Nri.Program`
  returns a `Html.Styled.Html msg` by default.
- [accessible-html](https://github.com/tesk9/accessible-html), or how to
  ensure that accessibility is a first class citizen in your app. I think
  that this library is also a great case study on how to create a light
  wrapper around another library.
- [elm-review](https://github.com/jfmengels/elm-review), a must-have
  addition to any Elm project. It will detect unused variables, unused
  variants, unused modules, and much much more. Use it!
- [elm-json-decode-pipeline](https://github.com/NoRedInk/elm-json-decode-pipeline),
  another approach at writing JSON decoders. I love how easy it is to read
  and modify decoders written in this style.
